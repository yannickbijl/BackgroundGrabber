# BackgroundGrabber
Easily grab the beautiful artwork from various sources to set as background.

## Requirements
As the software is written in BASH it needs to run in a unix environment.  
It is possible to run BackgroundGrabber with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## How to Use
Download the project.  
Move to the directory.  
Run BackgroundGrabber with the following command:  
`bash BackgroundGrabber.sh -s {source} -o {output dir}`

BackgroundGrabber can use absolute and relative paths for the `output dir`.  
For `source` a valid string is needed.  
Valid strings are listed under Sources, together with a link to the artwork.
